Rgraph
======

RGraph is a Rails widget to help you put one chart in your views. I've development  the different classes and methods to obtain a chart in HTML5 (Currently, Line and Meter) . This plugin works with RGraph: HTML5 canvas graph library (http://www.rgraph.net).

Example
=======

In Controller
+++++++++++++++++++++

#This method includes an action in the controller to obtain a CSV file with data of a chart.
rgraph_includes

def index

	# Make a Meter chart and set the different parameters.
	# You can set any parameter and get his value with get_method.
	
  a = Rgraph::Meter.new
  a.min = 10
  a.max = 100
  a.green_interval(10,50)
  a.yellow_interval(50,60)
  a.red_interval(60,100)
  a.value = 80
  a.set_title("Graph 1")
  
  @meter = rgraph_object_and_div(300,200, a)
  
  @line = Rgraph::Line.new
  @line.values = [[12, 23, 34, 56]]
  @line.chart_labels = [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003]
  @line.show_regression = true
  @line.calculate_regression
  @line.generate_tooltips
  @line.chart_annotatable = true
  @line.chart_key = ['Users']
  
  @lines = rgraph_object_and_div_and_csv(300, 200, @line)

end

In view (index.rhtml)
+++++++++++++++++++++++

<html>
<head>
	<title>Test</title>

 	<%= rgraph_includes (["meter.js", "line.js"])%>
 
</head>

<body>

	<p>Chart with a meter format</p>
	<%= @meter[1] %>
	
	<br/>
	
	<p>Chart with a line format</p>
	<%= rgraph_get_csv_file(@lines[2]) %>
	<%= @lines[1] %>

	<br/>
	
</body>

</html>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The method rgraph_includes generates the includes of javascript necessary to work correctly with RGraph. You can use the rgraph_get_csv_file method to get the data of a chart in a csv file.
